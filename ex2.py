''' How to make a multiline comment A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
Anything after the # is ignored by python. Not technicaly a comment.
this is just a weird quirk, the program still reads this.
'''
import time
print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also ise a comment to "disable" or commont out code:
print("This won't run.")
time.sleep(3) # three seconds is a long time.
print("This will run.")
